/*Test Cases:
245+343=588 results in 'Correct'
451+291=722 results in 'The correct answer is 742'

444-630=-186 results in 'correct'
971-732=528 results in 'The correct answer is 239'

95*7=665 results in 'correct'
51*3=174 results in 'the correct answer is 153'

174/6=27 results in 'the correct answer is 29
680/8=65 results in 'correct'

entering 7 or -2 at the menu tells user to give a valid input
